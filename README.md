React + Vite with Express Backend
This project provides a minimal setup for a React frontend powered by Vite, integrated with a simple Express.js backend. This allows you to develop full-stack applications with a fast frontend development experience and a robust Node.js API.

Project Structure
The repository is organized into two main parts:

your-project-name/
├── client/          # Your React + Vite frontend application
└── server/          # Your Express.js backend API
Features
Frontend (React + Vite)
React 18: Modern React for building user interfaces.
Vite: An incredibly fast build tool for frontend development, offering instant hot module replacement (HMR).
ESLint: Pre-configured ESLint rules for code quality.
API Integration: Demonstrates how to fetch data from the Express backend and send data via POST requests.
Backend (Express.js)
Express.js: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
CORS Enabled: Configured with cors middleware to allow cross-origin requests from the frontend during development.
dotenv: For managing environment variables securely.
Simple API Endpoints: Includes example GET and POST routes.
Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended)
npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn
Installation and Setup
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd your-project-name
Install Backend Dependencies:

Navigate into the server directory and install the necessary packages.

Bash

cd server
npm install
Create Backend Environment File:

In the server directory, create a file named .env and add the following:

PORT=5000
You can change the port if 5000 is already in use.

Install Frontend Dependencies:

Navigate into the client directory and install its dependencies.

Bash

cd ../client # Go back to the root then into client, or directly if you are in the root
npm install
Running the Applications
You'll need to run both the backend and frontend concurrently.

Start the Backend Server:

Open your first terminal and navigate to the server directory:

Bash

cd server
npm start
You should see a message indicating that the server is running (e.g., "Server is running on port 5000").

Start the Frontend Development Server:

Open your second terminal and navigate to the client directory:

Bash

cd client
npm run dev
This will start the Vite development server (usually on http://localhost:5173).
